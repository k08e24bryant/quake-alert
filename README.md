# quake-alert

Earthquake alert service for Indonesia. A worker polls BMKG Open Data, stores quakes in
PostgreSQL + PostGIS, exposes a geospatial REST API, and notifies subscribers about quakes
near them.

Earthquake data: **BMKG (Badan Meteorologi, Klimatologi, dan Geofisika)** —
<https://data.bmkg.go.id/>.

## Development

Requirements: Docker, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

### Run the stack

```sh
cp .env.example .env                  # optional: compose ports/credentials
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env  # app settings for running outside Docker
docker compose up --build
```

| Service  | What it does                                                      |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `db`     | PostgreSQL 16 + PostGIS 3.5 (`postgis/postgis:16-3.5`)            |
| `redis`  | Redis 7: arq job queue                                            |
| `api`    | Runs `alembic upgrade head`, then FastAPI with auto-reload on :8000 |
| `worker` | arq worker (`worker.settings.WorkerSettings`)                     |

- `GET /healthz`: liveness. The process is up; no dependencies are checked.
- `GET /readyz`: readiness. 200 when PostgreSQL and Redis are reachable, 503 with the
  failing check(s) otherwise.

If ports 5432/6379/8000 are taken on your machine, set `POSTGRES_PORT`, `REDIS_PORT` or
`API_PORT` in the root `.env`, and update the URLs in `backend/.env` to match.

### Backend checks

From `backend/`, with `db` and `redis` running:

```sh
uv sync
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy
uv run pytest                     # unit + integration
uv run pytest -m "not integration"  # unit only, no services needed
```

Integration tests run against a real PostGIS database. `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (default
`quake_alert_test`) is **dropped and recreated** each run and migrated through Alembic.
Each test runs inside a transaction that is rolled back afterwards.

### Migrations

```sh
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs ruff, mypy and pytest against PostGIS and Redis
service containers.
